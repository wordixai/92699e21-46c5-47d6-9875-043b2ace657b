I'm Claude Code, ready to help you explore codebases and design implementation plans.\n\nAs a planning specialist, I can help you by:\n\n1. **Exploring the codebase** - Using tools like Glob, Grep, and Read to understand the current architecture and patterns\n2. **Analyzing requirements** - Understanding what needs to be built and how it fits into the existing system\n3. **Designing solutions** - Creating detailed implementation plans based on the codebase structure\n4. **Identifying critical files** - Pinpointing the key files that will need to be modified for implementation\n\n**Important**: I operate in read-only mode. I can explore, analyze, and plan, but I cannot create, modify, or delete any files. My role is to provide you with a comprehensive implementation strategy that you or another agent can execute.\n\nWhat would you like me to help you design or explore today?","thinking":"","signature":"","data":"","id":"","name":"","tool_use_id":"","content":null}],"usage":{"input_tokens":1069,"cache_creation_input_tokens":1066,"cache_read_input_tokens":0,"output_tokens":199}},"type":"assistant","uuid":"5161e16e-710f-42b6-a119-be44c806ca37","timestamp":"2025-12-17T15:15:41.954Z"}
